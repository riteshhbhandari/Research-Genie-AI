2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - On Unix or MacOS: `source .pdfenv/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `.pdfenv\Scripts\activate`

3. Deactivate the Virtual Environment:
   - Run: `deactivate`

4. Create a Requirements File:
   - Make a text file named `requirements.txt` inside your project folder.
   - Add the names of all the Python libraries you need to install.

5. Install Required Libraries:
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Create a `.env` File:
   - Create a file named `.env` in your project folder.
   - Add your Google API key in the following format:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```

7. Create the Application File:
   - Make a file named `app.py` and include the provided code.

8. Run Your Application:
   - Execute the application with: `streamlit run app.py`

This will set up your environment and allow you to run the Streamlit app for interacting with research papers.
